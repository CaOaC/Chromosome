We carried out hybrid Brownian-Gillespie simulations of the polymer dynamics for the swimming motors. The programs can run in parallel on Cuda software. We use periodic boundary conditions without considering the self-avoiding and excluded volume effect. In addition, we solve the self-consistent equation by an iterative method.
